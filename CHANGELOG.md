### Changes

#### Element Role

##### Bug Fixes

- **change folder name to match artifact** ([`a76ebb1`])

  During the renaming of Riot to Element, the path for the webapp changed
  from /opt/riot to /opt/element. In those folders, the archives are
  unpacked, resulting in paths like /opt/element/riot-v${version}. Since
  the archives are not yet renamed
  (https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/14896), this riot
  reference has to stay for now. In the renaming, this was accidentally
  changed prematurely, resulting in this regression.

### Changes

#### Element Role

##### Updates

- **bump version to 1.7.3** ([`e2fbaf6`])

##### Refactoring

- **rename riot role to element** ([`5a777cd`])

  Riot is now Element, and therefore this role has to do a lot of
  `s/riot/element/g`. There's still a few references to riot here and
  there, but fixing those depends on external changes.

  This does not attempt any automatic migration, you will need to clean
  up the old webroot or container yourself.


#### Synapse Role

##### Bug Fixes

- **fix location of signing key module** ([`40510a6`])

##### Updates

- **bump version to 1.18.0** ([`d1edba8`])


#### Riot Role

##### Updates

- **bump version to 1.7.2** ([`6be0252`])
